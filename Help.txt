Battery Aging Evaluation Program (BAE) Guide

1. Log in:
   - Click the lock icon to log in with your username and password.
   - User credentials are validated using the 'BAE_Login.json' file.

2. Enable the Data Cleared Tick Box:
   - Click the "Data was Cleared" tick box to confirm that all old aging data has been cleared prior to starting a new test.

3. Select a File:
   - Use the dropdown menu to select an Excel or CSV file containing aging test data.
   - File paths are read from the 'BAE_File_Paths.json' configuration file.

4. Start Test:
   - Click the 'Start Test' button to begin analysis.
   - The program will:
     a. Load configuration parameters from 'BAE_Config_Parameters.json'.
     b. Identify key points in the data (maximum voltage, minimum voltage, etc.).
     c. Check for alarms using 'BAE_Alarms.json'.
     d. Compare the data against expected values (battery voltage (V), remaining capacity (Ah), cell voltage differences (V)).
   - Results are displayed in the main output panel, indicating whether the test passed, passed with concession, or failed.

5. View Graphs:
   - Use the dropdown menu in the graph controls section to select a parameter (battery voltage (V), remaining capacity (Ah), cell voltage differences (V)).
   - Click 'Display Graph' to view the graph.
   - Click 'Clear Graph' to remove the graph.
   - Graphs are interactive; click on points to see their coordinates.

6. Reset:
   - Click the 'Reset' button to clear all results, graphs, and reset the interface.
   - This allows you to start a new test without restarting the program.

7. Quit:
   - Click the 'Quit' button to exit the application safely.

8. Results Storage:
   - Test results are saved in JSON format in the folder specified in 'BAE_File_Paths.json'.
   - Excel test files are saved in the folder specified in 'BAE_File_Paths.json'.
   - Results are also uploaded to the FTP server and, if enabled, to SharePoint.

9. Alarm Checking:
   - The program checks for:
     a. General failure alarms.
     b. Point-specific alarms (highest voltage point [Point 1], lowest voltage point [Point 2]).
   - If alarms are missing or unexpected alarms are found, the test fails and details are displayed in the main output panel.

10. Configuration Files:
    - The program relies on several JSON files for configuration:
      a. 'BAE_Login.json': Stores user credentials.
      b. 'BAE_File_Paths.json': Specifies paths for test data and result storage.
      c. 'BAE_Config_Parameters.json': Defines expected values for test parameters.
      d. 'BAE_Alarms.json': Lists alarms to check during the test.
      e. 'BAE_SharePoint_Config.json': Contains SharePoint and upload settings.
